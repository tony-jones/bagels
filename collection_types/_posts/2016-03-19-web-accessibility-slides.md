author: Anthony Jones
excerpt: I was asked to make a presentation to faculty and staff about web accessibility in Higher Education. This slideshow covers our goals, the basics of web accessibility, and the current state of the U.Va Library's web presence. The University has a committment to accessible education and we strive to remove barriers of access to those with disabilities.
