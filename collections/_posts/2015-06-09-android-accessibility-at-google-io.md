subtitle: A summary of Android accessibility services covered during talks at Google IO 2015
author: Anthony Jones
excerpt: Phil Weaver, Eve Andersson, Casey Burkhardt, Hugh Oh, and Mark Riccobono presented at Google IO on Android accessibility and how we can remove and replace assumptions about users and how they interact with Android apps. I will briefly cover three means of achieving this and the assumptions that come along with each technology.
